Question 1: Create an object that describes a train ticket and 
store it in the ticket variable. The object must have three fields:

-starting station (key name from, give the name of the nearest station in your area as a value);
-end station (key name to, give any other station within 100km as a value);
-the price of the ticket (key name price, give the amount you would like to pay for this ticket as a value).

The object must be created using curly brackets, 
in which all created fields will be listed immediately. 
Then display the values of all fields of the ticket on the console.

/*Question 2:

Using dot notation, add the name and surname fields to the 
object by entering your data as values. 
Try to display the individual fields on the console. */
